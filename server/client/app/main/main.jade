    .row
      .col-sm-12
        p Currently, 3 tuning methods are implemented in IR Studio: iRace, Ablation analysis and the one-factor-at-a-time method. After carrying out
          | an exploration, it is possible to create reports. When trying several explorations with various tools on the
          | same scenario, you can also create aggregated reports, which will allow to visually combine and
          | confront the output of these tools.

        p The irace package implements the iterated racing procedure, an extension of the Iterated F-race procedure.
          | It builds upon the race package by <a href='#'>Birattari</a> and it is implemented in R.<br />
          span.text-muted Note: to use iRace, you must install the
            a(href='http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/irace/')  iRace package
            | .

      .col-sm-4
        h4 Ablation analysis
        p This procedure investigates the path of configurations obtained by iteratively modifying parameter settings
          | from a source configuration (e.g., an expert-defined default) to those from a target configuration (e.g., one
          | obtained from an automatic configurator).

      .col-sm-4
        h4 One factor at a time
        p This tuning method takes an initial candidate and does a sort of exhaustive search in the parameter space.
